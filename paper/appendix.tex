\section{History and Computational Status}
\label{app:history}
%% =========================================================================

Mullin posed the conjecture in 1963~\cite{Mullin1963}.  In over sixty
years, no proof has been found, and no theoretical approach has come
close.  The problem sits in an unusual position: it is elementary to
state, each individual step is deterministic, yet the global behavior
of the sequence appears completely intractable.

\paragraph{The largest-factor variant.}
Cox and van der Poorten~\cite{CoxVdP1968} showed that the related sequence using
the \emph{largest} prime factor---where each term is
$\operatorname{gpf}(\Prod(n) + 1)$ instead of $\minFac$---provably
misses infinitely many primes (for instance,~$5$ never appears).  By
always jumping to the largest factor of $\Prod(n) + 1$, the sequence
leaps past small primes and can never return to them, since each Euclid
number is coprime to every earlier term.  This refuted the natural
strengthening that surjectivity holds regardless of the factor-selection
rule, and showed that the $\minFac$ rule is essential to the conjecture.

The two selection rules are also structurally different.  The largest
prime factor $P^+(n) = \operatorname{gpf}(n)$ has rich algebraic
structure: the sets $\{n : P^+(n) \leq y\}$ (smooth numbers) are
controlled by the Dickman function, and for polynomial sequences
$f(n) = \Prod(n)+1$ one can sometimes exploit algebraic curves and
Hasse--Weil bounds.  In contrast, the smallest prime factor
$P^-(n) = \minFac(n)$ is purely a \emph{sieve} object: controlling
$P^-(n)$ requires excluding small prime divisors one at a time (CRT
$+$ Mertens), and no algebraic-geometric handle exists.  This
$\operatorname{gpf}$/$\minFac$ asymmetry is one reason the largest-factor
variant admits a short proof while the smallest-factor conjecture
remains open.

\paragraph{Variants and surveys.}
Booker~\cite{BoSa2012} showed that a carefully chosen variant of the
Euclid--Mullin sequence \emph{does} contain every prime: by selecting a
specific (not necessarily smallest) prime factor at each step, one can
steer the sequence to hit every prime.  This demonstrates that the
conjecture is \emph{delicate}: the surjectivity depends on the precise
rule, not just the Euclidean structure.  Pollack and
Trevi\~{n}o~\cite{PollackTrevino2014} surveyed the problem's place in
the broader landscape of Euclid-inspired sequences, and studied
distributional properties of primes ``forgotten'' by Euclid-type
constructions.

\paragraph{Computational status.}
The sequence has been extended through a series of large-scale
factoring efforts:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item Wagstaff~(1993) computed through the 43rd term.
\item In 2010, the 180-digit number $\Prod(43) + 1$ was factored via
  GNFS (General Number Field Sieve), yielding a 68-digit prime as
  $a(44)$.  Terms $a(45)$--$a(47)$ followed.
\item In 2012, Propper factored the 256-digit number $\Prod(47)+1$ by
  ECM (Elliptic Curve Method), discovering a 75-digit factor and
  extending the sequence to 51~terms
  (Booker--Irvine~\cite{BoIr2016}).
\item Finding $a(52)$ requires factoring a 335-digit number.  No
  factorization is known as of 2025.
\end{itemize}
After 51~terms, the smallest primes not yet observed are $41$ and $47$.
Note that $31$---a smaller prime---does not appear until position~$50$.

\paragraph{Why computation cannot resolve the conjecture.}
Even heroic computation is fundamentally unable to address the
conjecture.  Each new term requires factoring a number whose digit
count grows roughly linearly with the number of terms, quickly
exceeding the reach of any known factoring algorithm.  But even if we
could compute millions of terms, this would prove nothing: the
conjecture is a $\forall$-statement over all primes, and no finite
computation can rule out the possibility that some prime first appears
at an astronomically large index.

More fundamentally, the sequence exhibits a sensitive dependence on its
full history.  Each term $a(n+1) = \minFac(\Prod(n)+1)$ depends on the
\emph{complete factorization} of a number that encodes all previous
terms.  Changing a single early term alters every subsequent one.  This
global coupling is what makes the sequence appear random despite being
deterministic, and it means that local or statistical reasoning
about ``typical'' behavior is unreliable.  There are no known density
arguments, probabilistic heuristics, or sieve-theoretic bounds that
bear on the conjecture.  The problem requires a structural argument
about the sequence's long-term dynamics---which is precisely what the
formalization in the body of this paper provides.

%% =========================================================================
\section{Analogies and Context}
\label{app:analogies}
%% =========================================================================

Mullin's Conjecture has no known applications: if proved tomorrow, no
other theorem in number theory would follow from it.  The value of the
problem lies instead in what it \emph{is an instance of}---and in the
methods its resolution would require.  The orbit-specificity barrier
identified by this formalization appears, in recognizable form, across
several active areas of mathematics.

\paragraph{Artin's conjecture and the orbit-specificity gap.}
The closest structural analogue to MC is Artin's conjecture on
primitive roots~\cite{Artin1927}: for any integer $a \neq -1$ that is not a
perfect square, the group $(\ZZ/p\ZZ)^\times$ is generated by~$a$ for
infinitely many primes~$p$.  The parallel is precise:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Artin} asks whether the orbit of a fixed generator~$a$
  under repeated multiplication fills $(\ZZ/p\ZZ)^\times$.
\item \textbf{Mullin} asks whether the orbit of~$2$ under
  multiplication by successive EM primes in $(\ZZ/q\ZZ)^\times$ hits
  the single element~$-1$.
\end{itemize}
Both conjectures are blocked by the same fundamental obstacle:
transferring \emph{averaged} equidistribution results (which hold for
most moduli or most generators) to \emph{one specific deterministic
orbit}.  Hooley~\cite{Hooley1967} proved Artin's conjecture conditional on GRH
for Dedekind zeta functions of Kummer extensions---because GRH
provides the uniformity across individual characters needed to control
a single orbit.  In our setting, this uniformity is exactly what CCSB
demands.

The analogy is not merely structural.  The Kummer extensions
$\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_\ell, a^{1/\ell})$ that appear in Hooley's proof
are the same extensions that arise in the EffectiveKummerEscape
approach to SubgroupEscape (Section~\ref{sec:open}).  The elementary
PRE lemma (Theorem~\ref{thm:pre}) sidesteps this Chebotarev machinery
entirely for the algebraic component, but the dynamical
component---does the walk \emph{hit}~$-1$, not merely \emph{generate}
the full group?---remains exactly the orbit-specificity gap that GRH
closes for Artin and that no known tool closes for Mullin.

\paragraph{Multiplicative walks on finite groups.}
The walk reformulation (Section~\ref{sec:walk}) places MC in the
framework of random walks on finite groups, studied systematically by
Diaconis and others since the
1980s~\cite{ChungDiaconisGraham1987}.  The Diaconis--Shahshahani upper
bound lemma~\cite{DiaconisShahshahani1981} shows that a random walk on a finite group~$G$
driven by i.i.d.\ multipliers from a conjugation-invariant
distribution mixes in $O(\log |G|)$ steps, with mixing measured by
character sums.

The EM walk has the same algebraic structure---a multiplicative walk
on the cyclic group $(\ZZ/q\ZZ)^\times$---but violates every
assumption of the classical mixing theory.  The multipliers are
deterministic, not random; they are not identically distributed; and
most critically, the multiplier at step~$n$ depends on the walk
position at step~$n$, creating exactly the position-multiplier
correlation that the Diaconis--Shahshahani framework assumes away.
CCSB is the precise derandomization of the mixing-time bound: it asks
that the Fourier coefficients of the walk's occupation measure tend to
zero for every non-trivial character.

\paragraph{Smallest prime factor distribution.}
The SieveTransfer hypothesis (Section~\ref{sec:open}) connects MC to
the distribution of the smallest prime factor function
$P^-(n) = \min\{p : p \mid n\}$, studied by Alladi~\cite{Alladi1977},
Hildebrand~\cite{Hildebrand1986}, and others.  For generic integers in an arithmetic
progression $n \equiv a \pmod{q}$, the distribution of $P^-(n)$ is
controlled by the Dickman function and CRT-based equidistribution
results.  MC asks whether this equidistribution transfers from generic
integers to the specific subsequence $\{\Prod(n)+1\}_{n \geq 0}$.
The same orbit-specificity transfer problem arises for Mersenne
numbers $2^p - 1$, Fibonacci numbers, and polynomial iterates
$f^{\circ n}(a)$ in arithmetic dynamics.

\paragraph{The marginal/joint barrier and Sarnak's conjecture.}
The formalization identifies a precise meta-obstacle
(Section~\ref{sec:hard}): \emph{marginal} equidistribution of the
multiplier residues is provable (the EM primes are equidistributed in
residue classes, by Dirichlet's theorem); what MC requires is
\emph{joint} equidistribution of the pair (walk position, multiplier),
conditioned on the walk's history.  This barrier is an instance of a
broader phenomenon.  Sarnak's conjecture~\cite{Sarnak2010} asserts that the
M\"obius function $\mu(n)$ is orthogonal to every bounded
deterministic sequence:
$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} \mu(n) \, a_n \to 0$.
CCSB is a M\"obius-orthogonality-type statement for the EM sequence,
placing MC squarely within the Sarnak program's conceptual framework,
even though the EM sequence falls outside the technical scope of
existing results (which require zero topological entropy).

\paragraph{Greedy sieves and orbit-hitting.}
MC is the simplest nontrivial instance of a broader question: does a
greedy, deterministic prime-selection process eventually cover all
primes?  The Cox--van der Poorten result~\cite{CoxVdP1968} shows that this
determinism is fragile: choosing the \emph{largest} factor instead
provably misses primes.  More generally, MC belongs to the family of
\emph{orbit-hitting problems} in arithmetic dynamics: given a map~$T$
on a space~$X$ and a target set $S \subset X$, does the orbit
eventually enter~$S$?  Unlike Artin (where the map $x \mapsto ax$ is
the same at every step) or Collatz (where the map depends only on the
current state), the EM map varies at each step, determined by the
factorization of a number that depends on the entire orbit history.
This is the accumulator coupling of Section~\ref{sec:intro}: the
running product $\Prod(n)$ is a cumulative digest of the full orbit,
and the walk--multiplier framework makes it precise.  The
formalization shows it is the sole source of difficulty: once the
coupling is controlled (via CCSB or CME), MC follows by
machine-checked deduction.

\section{Additional Sieve and Spectral Routes}
\label{app:routes}
%% =========================================================================

This appendix collects the sieve and spectral-energy routes to MC that
complement the three principal reductions (DH, CCSB, BV) presented in
the body.  All reduction arrows are machine-verified; the sole open
content in each route is the orbit-specificity transfer.

\subsection*{Arithmetic Large Sieve Route}

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieve.lean\#L403}{arith\_ls\_chain\_mc}]
$\mathrm{ArithLS} + \mathrm{ArithLSImpliesMMCSB} \;\Longrightarrow\; \MC$.
\end{theorem}
The arithmetic large sieve gives character sum bounds for Dirichlet
characters (a known result, not in Mathlib).  The transfer
ArithLSImpliesMMCSB is open and is in fact a \textbf{dead
end}: universal coefficient bounds cannot distinguish equidistributed
walks from clumped walks.

\subsection*{Analytic Large Sieve Route}

The most developed route connects the analytic large sieve to MC via
Gauss sum inversion.

\begin{definition}[\defname{AnalyticLargeSieve} (\abbr{ALS})]
For well-separated points $\{\alpha_r\} \subset \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$
with $\min_{r \neq s} \|\alpha_r - \alpha_s\| \geq \delta$:
\[
\sum_r \left\|\sum_{n < N} a_n\, e(n\alpha_r)\right\|^2
\;\leq\; (N - 1 + \delta^{-1}) \sum_{n < N} \|a_n\|^2.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveAnalytic.lean\#L490}{weak\_als\_from\_card\_bound}]
\label{thm:weak-als}
A \emph{weak} version with constant $N \cdot (\delta^{-1} + 1)$ is
proved (the optimal constant is $N - 1 + \delta^{-1}$, but the
difference is immaterial since MMCSB requires only~$o(N)$).
\end{theorem}

The key bridge is \defname{Gauss sum inversion}: a Gauss sum
$\tau(\chi) = \sum_{a} \chi(a)\, e(a/p)$ intertwines multiplication
and addition on~$\ZZ/p\ZZ$, converting character sums to exponential
sums.

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveAnalytic.lean\#L304}{char\_sum\_to\_exp\_sum}]
\label{thm:gauss-inversion}
For a non-trivial character~$\chi$ mod~$p$ prime:
$\sum_n f(n)\, \chi(n)
= \tau^{-1} \sum_{b=1}^{p-1} \chi^{-1}(b) \sum_n f(n)\, \psi(bn)$.
\end{theorem}

The GaussConductorTransfer composes eight internal lemmas (all proved,
\S56--\S62) into the bridge from ALS to the prime arithmetic large sieve:

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveAnalytic.lean\#L1358}{als\_implies\_prime\_arith\_ls}]
\label{thm:als-prime}
$\mathrm{AnalyticLargeSieve} \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{PrimeArithLS}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveAnalytic.lean\#L1535}{als\_prime\_arith\_ls\_chain\_mc}]
$\mathrm{ALS} + \mathrm{PrimeArithLSImpliesMMCSB} \;\Longrightarrow\; \MC$.
\end{theorem}

The remaining open content is PrimeArithLSImpliesMMCSB: transferring
prime-modulus arithmetic large sieve bounds to multi-modular character
sum bounds for the specific EM orbit.

\subsection*{The Spectral Energy Route}
\label{sec:sve}

Instead of individual character sums, this route examines the
\emph{total energy} of the walk occupation measure
$V_N(a) = |\{n < N : \walkZ{q}{n} = a\}|$.

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveSpectral.lean\#L89}{walk\_energy\_parseval}]
\label{thm:walk-energy}
$\sum_\chi \|S_\chi(N)\|^2 = (q{-}1) \sum_{a \in (\ZZ/q\ZZ)^\times} V_N(a)^2$
\quad (Parseval).
\end{theorem}

The \emph{excess energy} $E(N) = \sum_{\chi \neq 1} \|S_\chi(N)\|^2$.
If $E(N) = o(N^2)$, then every non-trivial character sum is
individually~$o(N)$, which is CCSB.

\begin{definition}[\defname{SubquadraticVisitEnergy} (\abbr{SVE})]
For every missing prime~$q$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists
$N_0$ such that for $N \geq N_0$: $E(N) \leq \varepsilon N^2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveSpectral.lean\#L238}{sve\_implies\_mmcsb}]
\label{thm:sve-mc}
$\mathrm{SVE} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{MMCSB} \Longrightarrow \MC$.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Van der Corput and higher-order decorrelation.}
The van der Corput inequality bounds $|\sum z_n|$ via autocorrelations:

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveSpectral.lean\#L826}{van\_der\_corput\_bound}]
\label{thm:vdc}
$\left\|\sum_{n \leq N} z_n\right\|^2
\leq \frac{N + H}{H+1}\bigl(N + 2\sum_{h=1}^{H}
  |\mathrm{Re}\sum_{n \leq N-h} z_n \overline{z_{n+h}}|\bigr)$.
\end{theorem}

For the EM walk, lag-$h$ autocorrelations involve $h$-step multiplier
products.  At $h = 1$, the autocorrelation equals the multiplier
character sum (Theorem~\ref{thm:shift-one}), so VdC with a single
shift gives only $O(N)$.  Higher lags may decorrelate:

\begin{definition}[\defname{HigherOrderDecorrelation} (\abbr{HOD})]
For every missing prime~$q$, non-trivial~$\chi$, and $\varepsilon > 0$:
there exists $H_0$ such that for $H \geq H_0$, $N_0$ such that for
$N \geq N_0$ and all $1 \leq h \leq H$:
$\|R_h(N)\| \leq \varepsilon N$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveSpectral.lean\#L1038}{hod\_implies\_ccsb}]
\label{thm:hod-mc}
$\mathrm{HOD} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{CCSB} \Longrightarrow \MC$.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Conditional multiplier equidistribution.}

\begin{definition}[\defname{ConditionalMultiplierEquidist} (\abbr{CME})]
For every missing prime~$q$, non-trivial~$\chi$, $\varepsilon > 0$,
$N_0$ such that for $N \geq N_0$ and every
$c \in (\ZZ/q\ZZ)^\times$:
$\|\sum_{\substack{n < N \\ w(n) = c}} \chi(m(n))\| \leq \varepsilon N$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveSpectral.lean}{cme\_implies\_dec}]
$\mathrm{CME} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{DecorrelationHypothesis}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveSpectral.lean}{cme\_implies\_ccsb}]
\label{thm:cme-ccsb}
$\mathrm{CME} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{CCSB}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
The walk telescoping identity gives
$\sum \chi(w(n)) = \sum \chi(w(n))\chi(m(n)) - (\chi(w(N)) - \chi(w(0)))$.
The product sum decomposes by fiber:
$\sum \chi(w(n))\chi(m(n)) = \sum_a \chi(a) \cdot \sum_{w(n)=a} \chi(m(n))$.
CME bounds each fiber sum by $\varepsilon' N$; the triangle inequality
sums over at most $|(\ZZ/q\ZZ)^\times|$ fibers; the boundary term
$\chi(w(N)) - \chi(w(0))$ has norm~$\leq 2$ and is absorbed for large~$N$.
\end{proof}

This is the key reduction that bypasses PED, BRE, and the $d \geq 3$
barrier.  The proof works for all character orders because it uses
only the fiber decomposition and telescoping---no block rotation
estimate is needed.

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveSpectral.lean}{cme\_implies\_mc}]
$\mathrm{CME} \Longrightarrow \MC$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Compose \texttt{cme\_implies\_ccsb} with \texttt{complex\_csb\_mc'}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[\lean{EM/LargeSieveSpectral.lean}{cme\_chain\_mc}]
$\mathrm{CME} + \mathrm{PEDImpliesCSB} \Longrightarrow \MC$.
\end{theorem}

This older route through the Dec $\to$ PED $\to$ CCSB chain is
superseded by the direct CME $\to$ CCSB reduction above, which
requires no additional hypotheses.

\subsection*{The Complete Hypothesis Hierarchy}

\[
\mathrm{PED} \;<\; \mathrm{Dec} \;<\; \mathrm{CME}
\;\xrightarrow{\text{proved}}\;
\mathrm{CCSB} \;\approx\; \mathrm{HOD}
\;\approx\; \mathrm{SVE},
\]
where ``$<$'' means strictly weaker (proved implication, known not
to reverse) and ``$\approx$'' means equivalent.
HOD~$\Leftrightarrow$~CCSB via van der Corput;
SVE~$\Leftrightarrow$~CCSB via Parseval;
CME~$\Rightarrow$~CCSB via telescoping + fiber decomposition
(Theorem~\ref{thm:cme-ccsb}).

Every hypothesis implies MC.  The PED route has an open BRE bridge
for $d \geq 3$ characters, but this is now bypassed: the direct
CME~$\to$~CCSB arrow is proved for all character orders.  CME is the
\emph{sharpest sufficient condition}---the weakest hypothesis known
to imply MC.

\section{Methodology: Human--AI Collaboration}
\label{app:agents}
%% =========================================================================

This work was produced through a sustained collaboration between a
human author and an AI system (Claude, Anthropic) across 72+~sessions.
The human author directed the mathematical strategy---proof
architecture, dead-end identification, and editorial control---while
the AI system handled Lean~4 formalization, Mathlib API search,
literature scouting, and exploration of candidate proof strategies.

The interaction was organized at scale via an \emph{agent swarm}:
a multi-agent system built on the Claude Agent SDK\@.  The swarm comprises
seven specialized agents, each with its own system prompt, tool access,
and model:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item A \emph{coordinator} that reads the current proof state,
  selects the most promising action, dispatches specialists, and updates
  shared state files.
\item A \emph{formalizer} that writes and compiles Lean code
  in rapid iteration cycles.
\item A \emph{literature scout} that searches papers and Mathlib
  for relevant results.
\item Four \emph{attack vector specialists} focused on analytic,
  algebraic, combinatorial, and information-theoretic approaches.
\item A \emph{paper writer} that maintains this document.
\end{itemize}

Agent prompts are \emph{self-evolving}: after each session the
coordinator updates them to record dead ends, new Mathlib discoveries,
and shifted priorities.  This prevents agents from rediscovering settled
territory.  All agent state (progress, strategy log, findings) is stored
as git-tracked markdown, making the exploration history fully
reproducible.

The division of labor between human and AI was sharp:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item \textbf{Human:} mathematical direction, proof strategy,
  identification of dead ends, evaluation of intermediate results,
  architectural decisions on the reduction hierarchy, and editorial
  control over the final formalization and paper.
\item \textbf{AI (Claude):} Lean~4 formalization using Mathlib,
  Mathlib API search, literature scouting, exploration of candidate proof
  strategies, and drafting of this paper.
\end{itemize}

The human author guided the proof effort across 72+~sessions, suggesting
attack vectors (algebraic, analytic, combinatorial, sieve-theoretic),
identifying when an approach had reached a dead end, and pushing toward
the sharpest possible reductions.  The AI agents wrote all Lean code,
searched Mathlib for relevant lemmas, explored dozens of proof strategies
to completion or refutation, and maintained the evolving paper.

The swarm is optimized for formalization and reduction, not mathematical
discovery.  The next breakthrough, if it comes, will probably be a human
insight about the structure of $\minFac$ on EM products---not something
an agent finds by systematic search.
